    <br>Africa is a continent known for its exotic animal encounters, dramatic landscapes, world-class beaches, and rich cultural traditions.
    It’s a continent few explore in depth, yet one that always seems to captivate anyone who visits.
Stretching over 30 million square kilometers and home to over
1.2 billion people, Africa is a vastly diverse landscape — both geographically and culturally.
Most world maps end up distorting the continents true size, leading many to underestimate
its size (contrary to what a Mercator map shows, Africa is 14 times larger than Greenland!).
Clearly, there is a lot to see here.
Where many countries in Africa do have their struggles, there are also many places where tourism is booming.
Whether you’re looking for an intrepid budget backpacking experience or a more luxurious safari getaway,
 you’ll be able to find it somewhere on the continent.But how do you get around while you’re there?
To help you plan your next adventure around Africa, I’ve compiled a list of the best ways to get around — no
matter your budget!

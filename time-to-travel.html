    <br>Every year, we all ponder exotic locations and amazing adventures. We think of the trips we will take and the places we will meet.
And then we abandon those dreams as rapidly as we thought them up.We think of all the reasons why we can’t go. Why today isn’t perfect and we just have too many things to do.
Something comes up and our plans are put off until tomorrow as we wait for “the right time.”
When we have more money, more time off, when things aren’t so crazy – then we can travel. We just need the stars to align a little more.
But, here is a secret: it will never be the right time to travel.Today might not be the perfect day — but neither is tomorrow.
Tomorrow, there will still be bills to pay.Tomorrow, there still won’t be enough money.Tomorrow, there will still be someone’s wedding to attend or a birthday party to go to.
Tomorrow, there will still be planning to do.Tomorrow, you still won’t know if you are making the right decision.
Tomorrow, you will still second-guess yourself.Tomorrow, you’ll still find yourself putting off the preparation for one more day.
Tomorrow, you’ll find another excuse why you can’t go.Tomorrow, people you know will still sow the seeds of doubt in your head.
Tomorrow, you’ll still worry about all the bad stuff that might happen to you.Tomorrow, something else will come up.
When tomorrow does come, you’ll say to yourself, “Today isn’t the right day. Let’s try again tomorrow.”
Tomorrow will never be perfect.That perfect tomorrow will never come. Tomorrow will always be some vague day in the future.
If I had waited for the perfect day, I’d still be waiting. I’d still be waiting for someone to come with me or for just a little more money.
It was never perfect but I wanted to travel so I just had to go.Sometimes, you just have to take the leap and go for it. Ships aren’t mean to stay in a harbor – and you weren’t meant to wonder “what if?”
Because one day you’ll find you’ve run out of tomorrows.And you’ll be filled with nothing but sadness and regret.
So stop waiting.Stop making excuses.Today is your day.It’s never the right time to travel.Forget about tomorrow. Just go.
Everything will work out. Your bills will disappear when you cancel the services that generate them. You’ll make friends on the road. You’ll find ways to make money. You’ll thrive.
The world is full of possibility.And you’re capable of doing great things.But only if you start today!

    Tropical islands.As soon as I think of travel, it’s not long before my mind drifts to white sand beaches, azure blue water,
    and palm trees in tropical locales. When most people think of paradise, chances are they’re thinking of tropical islands
     is far-flung corners of the world. Lounging with a good book, drinking from coconuts, soaking up the rays. Does it get any better than that?
Tropical islands are that peaceful escape where the days drift by, the problems of the world melt away, and time slows down.
They are a sanctuary.I spent a month living on an island in Thailand and it remains one of the best months of my entire life.
I’m an avid beach lover. The sun and I get along quite well and there’s nothing I’d rather do than live on a tropical island someday.
Having grown up in Boston and spent many years living in New York City, one of the main purposes of my travels is to avoid winter.
Give me a beach and I am a happy man.I’ve been to many of the best tropical islands in the world (and there are so many of them).
After over a decade of travel and countless hours staring out into the ocean, I’ve done the “hard” research so you don’t have to!
If you’re looking for a tropical island to go on your next vacation, here are a list of my favorites!
